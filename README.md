## ðŸš€ **Hello, World!**

Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll find projects that I've worked on or am working on interesting or maybe even helpful. I'm currently a student at Ã‰cole 42 (School 42), and I have mostly projects related to my studies at the school. I also have a little bit of experience in GameDev, and I really love it. I like everything low level and foundational, like math, even though I can't say that I'm a genius or that I can solve every mathematical problem you throw at me. I just enjoy pondering about fundamental ideas in math, physics, and computer science. I find them fascinating!
